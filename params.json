Random colors, random font icons, their paired names, and Microsoft's translation api.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlus there is a toggle, so now we can have it both ways - true statements or statements on representation - just as René intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n####Technical Colophon:\r\n- Sass,\r\n- Bootstrap,\r\n- Microsoft Translator API,\r\n- Node.js,\r\n- request.js,\r\n- fontello,\r\n- forever,\r\n- and Yeoman (for the scaffolding)\r\n\r\nA demo of the project is avialable [here](http://www.williamkamovitch.com/projects/rectifyingrene/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

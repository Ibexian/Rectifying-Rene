###Addressing the treachery of icon fonts

Project based on René Magritte's 'Treachery of Images' - you know, 'this is not a pipe' with a picture of a pipe above it?

[Ok, fine,  just go here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treachery_of_Images)

Good you're back. 

Well, I decided to turn it on its head -  through a combination of randomly generated true statements. Random colors, random font icons, their paired names, and Microsoft's translation api.


Plus there is a toggle, so now we can have it both ways - true statements or statements on representation - just as René intended.


####Technical Colophon:
-Sass,
-Bootstrap,
-Microsoft Translator API,
-Node.js,
-request.js,
-fontello, 
-and Yeoman (for the scaffolding)
